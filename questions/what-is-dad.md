title: What is Do-A-Doodle?
order: 0

Do-A-Doodle is a monthly event I organize where the members of the [Zedaph Discord server](https://www.patreon.com/zedaphplays) submit a creative work inspired by a random prompt.
This could be a literal doodle, but also a painting, a poem, a MineCraft build,... pretty much anything.

Near the end of the month, Zedaph and I go over all submitted works and comment on them in a video.
