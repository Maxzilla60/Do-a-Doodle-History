title: Where can I see the submissions?
order: 2

The actual submissions and names of the creates for each prompt will never be publicly shared (on this website) because:

- Do-A-Doodle is a relatively private event only for those who are part of the Discord server, I'm extending that privacy to the creators and their submissions.
- Hosting all those submissions would inevitably require a cost and I'd prefer to keep this website hosted for free.
