Back in July of 2019 we did a sort of "versus prompt" where we found out which was more popular through your submissions - Pirates VS. Ninjas! Friendly competition like this within the online artist community is nothing new, take Art Fight for example; Every July tons of artists sign up into two teams and "battle" each other by drawing each other's original characters! Let's take some inspiration from Art Fight's past team compositions and do another versus prompt! Which team will you be on, sun or moon?

This month, pick either "sun" or "moon" as the inspiration for your Do-A-Doodle piece and let's see which one ends up with the most submissions!
