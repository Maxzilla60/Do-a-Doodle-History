It's another October, the spookiest month of the year! Long time Do-A-Doodlers will know that we (I) usually do something wacky and/or special for my favorite month. But this year, let's try out simplicity. The ghoulish holiday of Halloween features many iconic monsters; vampires, ghosts, witches, etc. Get creepy and let one of your favorite Halloween monsters haunt your next creation!

This month, find your favorite Halloween monster and let it inspire a doodle, painting, photo, song, anything for this spooky Do-A-Doodle.
