And we're back! If you're a Do-A-Doodle veteran you are surely familiar with the wonderful yearly prompt of MerMay. In short, on the month of May artists online draw mermaids, just because! Let's take that prompt and apply it to a more emblematic creature in the Zedcraft Community; the sheep! SheepMay! Now you may say "But, Brilliant and Handsome Max, the month of May is almost over! This prompt is for June!" and you would be correct... _-cough-_ ...

This month, celebrate the _Zedaphiest_ animal ever, the sheep, by submitting your drawings, doodles, poems, photos, etc. for the very first SheepMay (ᵈᵉˡᵃʸᵉᵈ ᵇʸ ᵃ ᵐᵒⁿᵗʰ)!
