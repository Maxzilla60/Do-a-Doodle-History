Whatever wonderful creation you end up making for Do-A-Doodle, it eventually ends up digitalized into a whole buncha colored boxes. Y'know the ones; pixels! Whether it's through MineCraft's deliberate retro textures or someone building their favorite video game sprites in that very game, we all come in contact with these brilliantly minuscule dots on a daily basis. Let's embrace and zoom in on these wonderful pixels in this month's Do-A-Doodle!

This month, let pixels inspire you to make a drawing, pixel-art piece, painting, song, poem, etc. for your next submission!
