It seems fair to say that almost everyone has a favorite color, but can you flex your artistic talents around _just_ your favorite color - or any solidary color, for that matter? What do individual colors mean to you, what do they manifest in your imagination? It's been a while since we've had a bit of a challenge for Do-A-Doodle, so let's all get monochromatic this month!

For February, choose a single color to create and inspire your next painting, doodle, craft, etc. for Do-A-Doodle!
