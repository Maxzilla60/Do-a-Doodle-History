For this prompt I've generated three random emojis that will be the subject of your artistic expression! Interpret these three emojis in any sense you wish for your submission, they must all be included/represented somehow. If any of you remember, we've done something similar like this back in august of 2018 for a written-only prompt.

This month, write, paint, draw, act, etc. something inspired by the following three words: 🍒 🐙 🚂
