As time passes, Zedaph's Cave of Contraptions fills with interesting and creative machines and apparatus more and more. Let The Cave inspire you to come up with a new contraption! And no, it doesn't need to be a real plausible MineCraft redstone build nor does it have to be useful whatsoever.

For the month of June, come up and illustrate a new possible or impossible, useful or useless contraption you'd like to see alongside the many that are in Zedaph's Cave of Contraptions - with a drawing, MineCraft build, blueprint, song,... you name it!
