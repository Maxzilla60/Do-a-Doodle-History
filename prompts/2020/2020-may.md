It's the month of May and for many a' artists on the internet May is a special month known as MerMay! To celebrate creativity and, above all, mermaids, artists are prompted to draw a random mermaid every day of the month! Let's tag along with this wonderful idea and have it be the prompt for our Do-a-Doodle. Bonus points if you decide to take up one of the prompts for this year on the official website; https://www.mermay.com

This month draw, paint, invent, craft, build, sing,... about a mermaid (or merman, or merperson) - feel free to come up with a new _kind_ of merperson too! #MerMay2020 üßú‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
