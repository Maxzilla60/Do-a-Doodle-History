We're all here most likely because Zedaph has inspired us in some form or another... Well, let him inspire us once again for this month's Do-A-Doodle! I've asked him to provide anything that would serve as inpsiration for your next creative submission and boy is it some inpsiration indeed.

This month, let this magnificent doodle of "Doodle Dog", made by Zedaph himself, speak to your inner artist and muse you to your next drawing, song, painting, poem, etc.
