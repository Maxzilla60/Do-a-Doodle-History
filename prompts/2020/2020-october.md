It's finally here, the spookiest month of the year! And with that spookiness, we retell the scariest moment of Zedaph's life with a little comic strip. But unfortunately a piece of this story is missing... On a dark, cold, and lonely autumn night, Zedaph found himself suddenly being chased by the scariest thing he'd ever seen... but what was it?

This month, help us figure out the missing piece of this scary story by filling in the last panel of the provided comic with a doodle, painting, photo, anything! Feel free to edit, color, rearrange, etc. the other panels too! ðŸ‘»
