Looks like we're all getting settled well on the new season of the Zedcraft server. There are many projects going on but the one we'll find our inspiration from for this month's Do-A-Doodle is the soon-to-be best theme park EVER; Willy World! You may or may not have plans to build an actual ride for the server but this is Do-A-Doodle and the limit is your imagination! ðŸŽ¢ðŸŽª

This month, imagine and illustrate a ride or attraction you would love to see in a Willy World theme park!
