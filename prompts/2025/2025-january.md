Not to get too philosophical, but one of the principles of Do-A-Doodle is to find a spark of creativity in literally anything - to encourage you to find art in your surroundings. So, help us prove that point by taking any seemingly boring thing and framing it as art!

To kick off the new year, choose any mundane or everyday thing and illustrate it to its full artistic potential with an illustration, photograph, etc. for this month's Do-A-Doodle!
