It's safe to say we all love seeing a new Zedaph video pop up in our YouTube subscriptions. The fun even starts with the thumbnail: "What wacky thing has he been up to
_this_ time?". But have you ever felt you could give those thumbnails a little bit of your very own artistic input? Well, this month's your chance!

For the Do-A-Doodle of August, design your own thumbnail from scratch for one of Zedaph's videos or take an existing thumbnail and interpret it with your artistry!

⚠️ **To be clear; no submissions will be used to actually replace any of Zedaph's video thumbnails.**
