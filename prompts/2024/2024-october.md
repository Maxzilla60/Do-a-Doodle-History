A new bone chilling mob is being introduced into MineCraft's next update called The Creaking! With this new creepy monster and it being the spookiest month of the year, let's put our creative hands together and see what terrifying blocky creature we could come up with for our favorite game!

For the month of October, dream (or nightmare) up a new spooky mob for MineCraft and illustrate it with a drawing, poem, build, craft, etc. for Do-A-Doodle!
