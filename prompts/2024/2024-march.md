Brie-covered baguettes and goat cheese with honey.\
Parmesan shavings that make pasta yummy.\
Strong stilton ranch as a dip for my wings,\
These are a few of the cheesiest things.

Cheeses so cute that you could Babybel them.\
Jokes that require a father to tell them.\
"You must be a choir 'cause with you my heart sings"\
These are a few of the cheesiest things.

For March, let the word "cheese" inspire a doodle, drawing, build, craft,... for Do-A-Doodle! ðŸ§€ ðŸ«•
