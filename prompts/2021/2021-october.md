I've had enough! Zedaph thinks he's a scientist?? His experiments are absolute bogus, comparable to those oversaturated paper-mâché volcano kits for children! It's time to show him what science is truly capable of and the spookiest month of the year is a perfect time to do so.

Finally, after months of hard work I have completed my Monster Masher 8000!! All that's left is some monster parts - that's where you creative folks come in! I require from each of you a top half of a monster and a bottom half of a monster. I highly encourage you to submit two halves that are not from the same monster! I will then randomize your submissions and mash 'em up into a new horrific monstrosity to really make Zedaph cower in fear! Muahahahahaha!! ⚗️ ⚡
