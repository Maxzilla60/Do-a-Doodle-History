Something I've convinced myself: "If you're running out of Do-A-Doodle prompt ideas, you can always fall back on vague adjectives.". So, for February, let this random wacky adjective inspire your creativity; "upside down"!

¡ǝɥɔɐpɐǝɥ ɐ ɟlǝsɹnoʎ ǝʌᴉƃ puɐ uᴉɐɹq ɹnoʎ oʇ unɹ poolq ɥɔnɯ ooʇ ʇǝl ʇ,uop

This month, submit a story, photo, sketch, whatever invoked by the words "upside down".
