It's clear that, with the new 8th season of Hermitcraft, Zedaph has decided to really go all in with the scientist shtick. Science might be considered a rival of art but let's prove that notion wrong with this month's Do-A-Doodle!

In celebration of the start of the new Hermitcraft season and Zedaph's new style, let the entirety of science (!) inspire you to create a collage, doodle, experiment, song etc.
