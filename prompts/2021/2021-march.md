There are many simple questions you could ask a stranger to get to know them better. One of those that I always love to find out about someone is what their most favorite movie is. This month, let's get to know eachother's cinematic preferences through creative illustration! Also, as much as I'd love to play a game of guess-that-movie with Zedaph, make sure to include the title of which movie you've illustrated with your submission!

For the month of March, submit a build, doodle, painting, whatever about your favorite movie - be it a scene, character, poster rendition, etc.
