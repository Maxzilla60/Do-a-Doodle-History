The votes are in! For this year's month of May we once again participate in the artist community's very own MerMay! To celebrate creativity and, above all, mermaids, artists are prompted to draw a random mermaid (with a twist) every day of the month! Bonus points if you decide to take up one of the official prompts for this year on the official website; https://www.mermay.com

This month draw, paint, invent, craft, build, sing,... about a merperson and feel free to come up with your very own twist too! #MerMay2021 🧜‍♀️
