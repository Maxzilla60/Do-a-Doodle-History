You may already have heard rumors of a potential soft stuffed companion of a certain MineCraft-playing goofball we all collectively love coming to stores near you! To capture the hype, if you could turn anything you love into a markitable plush toy, what would you choose and - more importantly - what would it look like?

This month, design your very own plushie of anything you'd wish and illustrate it with a drawing, build, craft, etc.!
