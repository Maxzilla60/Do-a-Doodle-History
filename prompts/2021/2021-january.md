Minecraft never ceases to be a source of inspiration for creativity. "From blocks to mobs" - this month, let's have the game's many many different unique blocks provide us the inspiration for a creature of our own design!

This month, pick any random or favorite Minecraft block, come up with and design a creature inspired by it, and submit a doodle, drawing, art, etc. for this month's Do-A-Doodle. Feel free to do multiple in one submission!

Want a random block? Here's a tip; go to the MineCraft wiki (https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/) and click "Random Page" till you come across an entry for a block.
