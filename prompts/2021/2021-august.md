They say original ideas do not exist, originality comes from taking other ideas, and putting them together to make something new with it. Just as a painter would with their paint colors, let the word "mixed" put a spark in you to create something this month.

For the month of August, submit a painting, craft, recipe, photo, etc. inspired by the word "mixed".
