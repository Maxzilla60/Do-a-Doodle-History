It's clear that we might have seen the last of Wormman's former-villain sidekick, Evil Xisuma - him being banned and all. So, Wormman has contacted me to tell me he's looking for new sidekicks to fight side-by-side with and/or villains to fight against! #DontSpoilTheEndgame

This month, pitch Wormman's new superpowered sidekick and/or villain! Illustrate them, name them, share with us their wacky powers and maybe even their backstory!
