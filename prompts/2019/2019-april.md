Let's face it; Easter and its Easter Bunny is kind of a lame holiday and holiday mascot. 🥚🐰 I'm sure if we each could invent a holiday along with a mascot it would be ten times better!

This month, come up with a brand new holiday for the year with its own unique traditions and celebrations, and - most importantly - submit a drawing, doodle, etc. of the signature mascot for this holiday!
