We all know that as artists we can always improve, but never be the best. Which, obviously, means all famous artists are overrated! Let's prove that even the so-called "best" art and artists can always be better.

This month, submit a re-drawing, re-doodle, photoshop, remix, edit, etc. of your favourite (or not-so-favourite) classic and popular art piece.
