For many artists around the internet October is a special month, known as Inktober! Inktober involves making a drawing in ink according to a different prompt every day. Let's make use of this wonderful artistic challenge for Do-A-Doodle!

This month, let yourself be inspired by one or more of the prompts on the official 2019 Inktober prompt list (see below) to make an inky black-and-white piece of art! (Doesn't have to be a drawing)
