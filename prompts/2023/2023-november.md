One of the things us humans are so incredible at is our ability to recognize patterns. I believe this ability is a valuable piece in an artist's toolbelt. So, for this month's Do-A-Doodle, I challenge you to find two things that aren't twins but you feel are connected! Let's create some pods for some peas!

For November, find two things that you believe are similar in any way and let that inspire your next Do-A-Doodle submission!
