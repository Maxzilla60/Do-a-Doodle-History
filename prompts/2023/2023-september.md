Back in January of 2021 we took the vast collection of blocks MineCraft has to offer and turned some of them into fantastic living creatures. For this month's prompt we will take that same creature design idea and apply it to a different source... everyday household items!

This month, find the most mundane yet inspiring item in your house, come up with and design a creature inspired by it, and submit a doodle, drawing, art, etc. for Do-A-Doodle. Feel free to do multiple in one submission!
