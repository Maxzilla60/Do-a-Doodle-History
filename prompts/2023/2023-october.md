> *My dearest Do-A-Doodlers!*
>
> *Your wonderous creations from last month had inspired me so much that I swiftly decided to dust off my secret laboratory and make some experiments. But oh, my bumbling lab assistant, Zedaph, made a grave mistake!*
>
> *My invention went awry and it produced a fearsome blast of psychic energy across the globe. From my calculations, this would cause most of our amazing electronic technological advancements to gain hyperintelligence!*
>
> *Now, a truly terrifying disaster has befallen all of humanity as all our gadgets and gizmos have come to life to seek revenge on us! Mechanical mayhem! Computer chaos! Hi-tech havoc! Technological terror!*

During the month of October, let the concept of a robot uprising bring the deepest terror into your psyche and conjure a bloodcurdling depiction of it for Do-A-Doodle.
