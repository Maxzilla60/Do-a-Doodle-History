I think most of us can agree the Create mod is incredible, it's an impressively visual mod which can definitely get your creative juices flowing. So, it seems inevitable that Zedaph's joined in on making a series with it! Seeing Zedaph fit so well with this steampunky style and Create being such a creative mod, let us grab our tophats and goggles and get all geared up on some creations! 🚂 ☁️ ⚙️

This month, engineer yourself a drawing, painting, song, etc. inspired by the word "steampunk"! (Yes, I'm also surprised we haven't done this prompt yet!)
