After five years of reacting to your submissions, Zedaph and I realized we more than deserve some recognition for the genius art critiques we bring to this community event. That's right, this month's prompt is all about us, the brilliant hosts of Do-A-Doodle. We insist you muster your highest effort and pour your blood, sweat, and tears into depicting our awesome likenesses in all its impeccable glory for your next masterpiece. After all, we truly are the perfect muses, don't you agree?

**In all seriousness, in the spirit of April Fools, have your next submission be a ridiculous caricature of Zedaph and Max!**
