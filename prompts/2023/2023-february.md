Ah, to obscure thineself behind a facade of mystery. Dive empathically into another's identity. To express thineself more literally. The art of disguise. To be human is to recognize and acknowledge the existence of the other -- of those who are of thine kind yet differ from thee. Time for us as artists to reveal our masks!

For the month of February, let the word "mask" inspire a poem, song, painting,... a work of art and submit it for Do-A-Doodle! ðŸŽ­ðŸ‘ºðŸ¥¸
