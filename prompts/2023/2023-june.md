I think we can all agree Zedaph is quite the muse. And I've once again poked this bundle of imagination for another pinch of Do-A-Doodle inspiration. So, Zedaph presents to us... Potate-Tony! Let this adorable spud spark your creativity.

This month, let this magnificent doodle of "Potate-Tony", made by Zedaph himself, be the muse to your next drawing, song, painting, poem, etc. for Do-A-Doodle! ðŸ¥”
