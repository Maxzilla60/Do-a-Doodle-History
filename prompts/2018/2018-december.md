It's December, the last month of the year. That makes a _full year_ of Do-A-Doodles, huzzah! To celebrate one year of organizing this activity for this wonderful community, the prompt for this month is for you to flex your artistic muscles to illustrate your favourite Zedaph moment of all time! And I do mean "illustrate", because just submitting clips or screenshots are not allowed.

This month; make a drawing/make a painting/make some word-art/make a comic/edit up a video/write a story/do whatever about your favourite Zedaph moment!
