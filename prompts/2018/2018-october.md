It's October! It's the month of ghouls and ghosts, tricks and treats.... skeletons and pumpkins? Zedaph got invited to a costume Halloween party but, as expected, he totally forgot about it. Luckily he cobbled together a last-minute costume just in time for the party... That's right! This month, we get to **dress up Zedaph**! ðŸ¦‡

I've provided you with an "undressed" version of Zedaph, it's up to you to give him a spooky costume for the party! Draw over it, print it out, photoshop it, do whatever you need to it to make your costume idea come to life on Zed's ghostly body!
