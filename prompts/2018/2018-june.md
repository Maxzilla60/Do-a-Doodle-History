This month, you're being asked to submit a representation of yourself as... a puppet! What would you look like if Jim Henson himself would turn you into one of his famous puppets? Draw it, craft it out of a sock, sculpt it, whatever, as long as it's a googly-eyed version of yourself!

It's been 5 months of Do-A-Doodles and it has always been a collection of separate submissions. But _this time_, after all submissions are in, I will draw all these puppets in a kind of family picture! 🐸 🐷
